I'm using Helmet for security reasons.
In my auth, I don't know if I am doing my login route correctly. In the login route, I might need to fix the code moving on. I should refer to the comments I made.
I need to find a way to save my password for a specific user.
Some of the sources in my Citations and Sources txt may not actually be used.
Asterisks still work for my password. Now, I am using bcrypt.
I might need to make follow and unfollow the same function or integrate them together in a separate function.
My index.js is having some issues on it.
My index.js and my postings.js should have another look at it.
Might need to change the project name for NPX purposes.
