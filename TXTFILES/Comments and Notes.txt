I'm using Helmet for security reasons.
In my auth, I don't know if I am doing my login route correctly. In the login route, I might need to fix the code moving on. I should refer to the comments I made.
I need to find a way to save my password for a specific user.
Some of the sources in my Citations and Sources txt may not actually be used.
Asterisks still work for my password. Now, I am using bcrypt.
I might need to make follow and unfollow the same function or integrate them together in a separate function.
